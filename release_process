This is a short note on the process for creating an ImageMetaTag release
and making it available via conda

1) Develop, prepare and test your changes as normal, up to the point where
   the changes warrants a new release.

2) The release number should be changed using the Semantic versioning 
   convention (http://semver.org/)
 * The version number should be incemented in the following locations:
   * ImageMetaTag/__init__.py
   * ImageMetaTag/javascript/imt_dropdown.js
   * docs/source/conf.py
   * setup.py

2) Update the documentation, from the docs directory:
  cd docs
 * Clean the documentation build:
     make html clean
 * Rebuild the docs, ensuring that the PYTHONPATH refers to the source of the
   new build:
     PYTHONPATH=../ make html

3) Commit the version number and documentation changes:
  git commit -a
  git push origin {{ branch_name }}

4) Start a pull request for your branch on your github fork and follow the
   process to merge it to the master branch.

5)
